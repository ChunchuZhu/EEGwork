There are 19 Trials, each trial contains EEG, Vicon, and IMU data.The EEG is 32 channel. Peripheral EEG channels susceptible to eye blinks and facial/cranial muscle activity were removed from analysis, the retained 23 EEG channels includes the frontal cortex (F7, F3, Fz, F4, and F8), the central cortex (FC5, FC1, FC2, FC6, C3, Cz, and C4), the parietal cortex (CP1, CP2, P3, Pz, and P4), left temporal (T7, CP5, P7), and right temporal (T8, CP6, P8). The three Vicon markers are attached to the head.The IMUs are mounted on the chest, left, and right shank. The 9 columns of IMU data are:3-axis Angular velocity / 3-axis Linear acc / 3-axis Euler anglePlease run the DataProcessing.m file to get the 19 trials data.
